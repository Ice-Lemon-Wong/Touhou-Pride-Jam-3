#speaker Marisa
A spell card? Can I use this?

#speaker Alice
I don’t think this card game allows us to use spell cards against each other...

#speaker Marisa
Hey, you’ll never know. I can always copy the deck's power at will anyway. Hehe.

#speaker Alice
Ugh, you and your copying techniques. But I guess that’s how you get your spell cards...

#speaker Marisa
And obliterate them! How about you doll maker, whatchu’ got, huh? A bunch of dolls?

#speaker Alice
A bunch of elegant dolls, swarming around distracting you, while I gauge your abilities and find an opening.

#speaker Marisa
Ugh, boringgggg. But you know what isn’t boring?

#speaker Alice
You’re not suggesting us to-

#speaker Marisa
Yes, combine our abilities! We can be a great pair like last time! RIght?

#speaker 
Alice thought for a moment. The last time they worked together, it was filled with bickering and trash talking, both to themselves and the enemy. But if there is a chance to work together again...

#speaker Marisa
Whatchu’ thinking? 

#speaker Alice
U-Uh, nothing! Let’s continue one!

#speaker Marisa
Oooo, spell cards!

#speaker Alice
Thinking about copying moves again?

#speaker Marisa
Well, I still haven't craft the deck of cards I need, so...

#speaker 
Alice was glad to hear that. Had she made another deck, she would panic and worry who Marisa would give it to.

#speaker Marisa
Eh, maybe one day.

#speaker Alice
Your copying ability... What else can you copy?

#speaker Marisa
Hmm... I can only copy spell cards, so there isn’t much stuff I can copy. But...

#speaker 
Marisa pulled out a spell card. It looked nothing like before.

#speaker Marisa
I call this... “Producer of Objects”.

#speaker Alice
Uh, what does it do?

#speaker Marisa
It copies and produces an object of anything! I haven’t made a spell card myself, so I want to try it out now.

#speaker Alice
Where are you gonna try it on?

#speaker 
Marisa pointed to the can of drinks that Alice brought. Alice suddenly felt that was a bad idea.

#speaker 
And she was right. As Marisa cast the spell, the can of drink suddenly disappeared. They looked left and right, before hearing someone yell in pain. It was Cirno, and apparently, the can that Marisa teleported tracked where she was and fell onto her head. 

#speaker Alice
I... guess you should find someone to copy that spell of yours... Creating spells doesn’t seem like your forte.
Marisa: R-Right...

-card_3
#speaker Marisa
Ah, this card again.

#speaker Alice
Brings back memories, huh?

#speaker Marisa
Yeappp. Remember the time we paired up and fought Kaguya? That was a good time.

#speaker Alice
We got to fight so many people… But in the end, it was alright. We got to visit the moon.

#speaker Marisa
I wish we were there for a bit longer. I wanna visit the moon again before I go.

#speaker Alice
Hehe, another date together?

#speaker Marisa
Well, why not?

#speaker 
They laughed together. Alice imagined themselves at the moon again, looking at Gensokyo from above, admiring the view. She wished she wasn’t such a prick towards Marisa at that time, but she, as a youkai, looked down on her, and could see her as an equal. 
And now, they are more than just equals. They are lovers.

#speaker Alice
Maybe we can inquire about immortality over there.

#speaker Marisa
Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I guess.

#speaker Alice
<i>Wait. What was that tone, does she not seek immortality..?</i>
