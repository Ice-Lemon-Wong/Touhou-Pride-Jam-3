#Speaker Marisa
hello
this is to test the file loading system
#Speaker Alice
if you can read this that means the file is loading alright


-Start
#Speaker Alice


#portrait 0 alice happy
#animate 0 neutral
#animate 0 enter
#portrait 0 enable
#portrait 1 enable


<color=red>t</color><color=orange>h</color>is is to test if dialouge can start here
#portrait 0 alice smug
#animate 0 jump
//skip this part

this is the typing effect, it is basically the characters appear one by one

<color=blue><s>if it does</s></color> then it is working
#colour white

#animate 1 shake
#portrait 1 marisa cry
if I am shaking it also means that my animation is working
#animate 1 shake
the writer can write stuff in the txt file that controls the while dialogue flow

#portrait 1 disable
#portrait 0 disable
#portrait 2 enable
#portrait 2 alice2 baseNormal
#portrait 2 alice2 happy
this is to test if the third protrait is working peroperly
#portrait 2 alice2 baseEat
