#speaker Alice
Is that...?

#speaker Marisa
Oh wow, it’s the idiot fairy!

#speaker Alice
Hey, don’t be like that. Every living being has intelligence, you know?

#speaker Marisa
Well, not for her.

#speaker Alice
Okay, why is that?

#speaker Marisa
I once told her that the Scarlet Devil Mansion had a grand opening of their mansion. At first she wouldn’t believe me, but I pulled out a fake copy of my pass to the Library.
Then, she took my pass away and tried to actually enter the library. She didn’t even know that the Scarlet Devil doesn’t have a physical pass! Even Koakuma knows why not to have it.

#speaker Alice
Uh-huh...

#speaker Marisa
<color=#4d65b4>Then there was another time. I was sparring with her.
She kept using her signature spell card “Icicle Fall”, but she constantly misses every shot. I laughed so hard and she did not like that at all.</color>

#speaker 
Marisa realized Alice’s skeptical face.

#speaker Marisa
What’s wrong?

#speaker Alice
It’s just, my impression of her was that... She is a brilliant person with a hidden strategy.

#speaker Marisa
I-I’m sorry?

#speaker Alice
Like you, I sparred with her once. I employed my usual tactics, and simply overwhelmed her with my dolls.

#speaker Marisa
Uh, huh. And then?

#speaker Alice
Somehow, she placed mirrors on the dolls to triangulate my position and find out where I was amidst the chaos, and took me down, all during the battle!

#speaker Marisa
Wh-What?

#speaker Alice
Also, I fought her with my Goliath once. I kid you not, I was literally in the blender. When she explained how she defeated me, I was very confused.
She used unknown terms like “cross-ups”, “meaties”, “set-ups”, and even more. When I researched what she meant…

#speaker Marisa
...Those are fighting game terms?

#speaker Alice
Yeah, exactly! I’ve no idea that she plays fighting games! And applied it to defeat me! She’s a genius!

#speaker Marisa
Yeah, but those are on combat-

#speaker Alice
And, get this, she knows how to trick youkais to visit the Netherworld. Just by giving them directions to the realm, then she told them “This will make you stronger”.
When the youkais asked why they should believe her, she simply demonstrated her power!

#speaker Marisa
I, uh, heh, what? And it worked?

#speaker 
Alice nodded her head. Marisa was dumbfounded. 

#speaker Marisa
How could that idiot of a fairy be this… smart?

#speaker Alice
But if what you said is true, how could a smart fairy be this… dumb?

#speaker 
They looked down and thought hard, but eventually came out with the conclusion that this will take even longer than the game they are playing right now, and decided to discuss this another time.

#speaker Marisa
Hey, fairies!

#speaker Alice
Right, fairies huh? I find them quite easy to handle actually. You just need to treat them like children.

#speaker Marisa
Well, I also play pranks with them from time to time. It’s fun, really. You get to forget about the worries of life and just have fun playing in the Forest.

#speaker 
Marisa looked up to the ceiling while sipping her tea. The old lady’s wisdom speaking for Marisa.

#speaker Marisa
There are times where I wish I could live a carefree life like the fairies. Pranking people, being innocent and completely oblivious towards the world.
Sometimes, I just wish that I would go back to being a kid again, y’know?

#speaker 
The old witch shook her head, before facing Alice with her trademark smile.

#speaker Marisa
Don’t mind an old lady talking about being a kid again, will ya? Let’s just continue on with the game.

#speaker 
Alice only nodded. But in her mind, she has her doubts.

#speaker Alice
At this age, you should’ve learnt about it. Why don’t you seek immortality yet…?
