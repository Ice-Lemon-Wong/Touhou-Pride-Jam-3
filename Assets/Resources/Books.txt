#speaker Marisa
Books huh, I wonder what about them...

#speaker Alice
Other than the fact that you stole tons and tons of them for the quest of becoming the strongest magician, yeah, I wonder what about them.

#speaker Marisa
Hey, I “borrowed” them alright? I merely just forgot to return to them!

#speaker 
Alice only sighed from her response. That is what she always says. But there is a question that is bugging her.

#speaker Alice
If you steal so much from them, does that mean the library is actually useless to you?

#speaker Marisa
What do you mean?

#speaker Alice
I mean, you should’ve found what you needed to become the strongest by now, right? Why do you still seek more from them?

#speaker Marisa
Eh, some of them have stuff that I already know. Other times, it’s completely useless. Like, for some reason they're talking about gardening in Gensokyo. Really, gardening? Not my forte!

#speaker Marisa
But there are some secret books that I’m still looking for. And besides...

#speaker
The black witch chuckled.

#speaker Marisa
I can practice my thievery from the Library anyway, teehee!

#speaker Alice
<i>She is actually unsalvageable... But I guess she could surprise me more with her gifts.</i>

#speaker Marisa
Oh hey, it’s my favorite thing to “borrow” from!

#speaker Alice
You know, I am actually curious, is there anything new from the library? At the rate of you “borrowing” them, it’s a surprise you still have things to steal from.

#speaker Marisa
Yeah, they do supply new books, some of them replace the one I stole, some of them are newer books from Patchouli, and some are extra dangerous books that I would probably die if I mishandled them. 

#speaker Alice
Well now I’m curious, what are the contents of those “dangerous books”?

#speaker Marisa
Some of them would probably freeze you to the point of, according to them, cryostasis. Some would just cause your luck to plummet to the point where you could “unfortunately” slip and hit your head too hard. The worst among them all…

#speaker 
Alice, intrigued, leaned in. Marisa does the same, hoping her words would not be heard by the public as she whispers.

#speaker Marisa
...There are books that can summon tentacles and do... horrible stuff!

#speaker Alice
Eek!

#speaker 
Just as Alice showed her scared and disgusted face, Marisa laughed.


#speaker Marisa
Got you! Really now, if there were tentacles from a book, not only would I have stayed away from it forever, the Library would have a serious pet problem. 

#speaker Alice
You... pranked me?

#speaker Marisa
No. Pfft. Of course not.

#speaker Alice
Right, I also forgot you’re the worst liar among the people I know…

#speaker
As her heart became still, Alice could not help but smile a little. Despite being pranked, she liked the way Marisa laughed at her. It is quite endearing and, dare she say, cute.

#speaker Marisa
Oh ho, it is my favorite item of all.

#speaker Alice
Other than dangerous magical artifacts, I guess.

#speaker Marisa
There are a lot more safer to handle. Especially grimoires. Which reminds me…

#speaker Marisa
Where is your grimoire?

#speaker 
Alice was taken aback at the question.

#speaker Alice
Uh, what about it?

#speaker Marisa
I always saw you carry it, but you never used it in your fights. Why’s that?

#speaker Alice
Well, I just prefer using my dolls.

#speaker 
Marisa does not seem impressed by her answer

#speaker Marisa
...Is there a much bigger reason than that?

#speaker Alice
What do you mean?

#speaker Marisa
All I’m saying is, you could’ve unleashed hell on Gensokyo if you just opened your grimoire and used it. So, why not?

#speaker 
Alice sipped her drink, before clearing her throat.

#speaker Alice
I just love my dolls. Each and every one of them are perfect in my eyes. I wouldn’t want to throw them away unless I absolutely have to. That said, using my grimoire would put all my doll’s life in danger. And I don’t want all my dolls to be gone.

#speaker Alice
Even though I am an immortal and have plenty of time to replace my lost, I can’t bring myself to end each and every doll’s life using a magic book. It’s too inhumane, by my standards. Plus, I rather spend time trying to make the perfect doll anyway, instead of making more of the same.

#speaker Marisa
Wow, never thought you’ll think like that before. I kinda like it.

#speaker 
Sometimes, Marisa’s directness made Alice weak. Those compliments were definitely aiming at her heart, but she kinda liked it.

#speaker Alice
A-Anyway, what about your grimoire? Do you bring it here with you?

#speaker Marisa
H-Heh, what?

#speaker Alice
You heard it. Can I read your grimoire?

#speaker Marisa
No way, it could destroy this entire place!

#speaker Alice
...You’re mocking me, aren’t you?

#speaker Marisa
No way! Besides, I haven’t even taken a look at your grimoire, how would I know?

#speaker 
Seeing that there is no way she’ll get Marisa revealing her grimoire, she gives up.

#speaker Marisa
...Do you want to buy my grimoire though? You’ll know what I wrote for you in your section~

#speaker Alice
<i>That’s actually tempting. I wonder what she wrote for me. Does she feel the same as me or...?</i>
No thanks. I’m afraid it is a direct copy of my spells.

#speaker 
Marisa only pouted as she placed the pair of Book cards away.

#speaker Marisa
Fineeeeee. Let’s continue with the game.
