#speaker Alice
Dolls, huh...

#speaker Marisa
Oooo, dolls? I kinda wanna know more about your dolls. What do they mainly do at your house?

#speaker Alice
Well, they help clean up the house, serve me tea, cook food for me, so on, so forth.

#speaker Marisa
Erm, really? That’s it?

#speaker Alice
Are you expecting them to help me dress while feeding me cakes, bow down whenever I walk past them, and When they misbehave, I lecture them for hours?

#speaker Marisa
...Yes.

#speaker Alice
<i>You and your imagination I swear... But it does make our conversation a little bit more exciting, I suppose.</i>

#speaker 
Then there was silence, but not for long. Alice decided to use this opportunity to take a sip.

#speaker Marisa
So do you make dolls that look like me?

#speaker 
It was a bad time for Alice to take a sip of her drink. She almost spat it all out onto Marisa’s face.

#speaker Alice
Dolls of y-y-you?

#speaker Marisa
Ya heard me! Well, did you?

#speaker 
She gulped as many questions raced into her head. How did she know? Did she somehow place a magical item that spies on me? Did she finally put that thievery to good use and looked into my house?

Well, not that she minds anyway.

#speaker Alice
...Yes.

#speaker Marisa
Ok, well, how many?

#speaker 
Alice swallowed whatever that was inside her throat further down. She does not like lying after all, especially to Marisa, who has done so much for her.

#speaker Alice
...Ten.

#speaker 
At that moment, she saw Marisa’s face become red. She is blushing.

#speaker Marisa
Awww, you... actually care about me.

#speaker Alice
L-Let’s just continue on with the game alright?

#speaker Alice
Huh, a doll card.

#speaker Marisa
Speaking of dolls, I remember you had a gigantic one somewhere right? The one that Cirno had fought before.

#speaker Alice
Ah yes, the Goliath doll. I’m still finding ways to perfect it. What about it?

#speaker Marisa
I don’t know about you, but I believe two swords aren’t enough to finish off a Magician, nor a youkai. Why don’t you add something magical, like.... A magic wand or something?

#speaker Alice
Really? A gigantic doll, using its ludicrous speed to overcome its massive size, and you want it to cast spells?

#speaker Marisa
Hey, with its massive body, it could contain a lot of magical energy! So why not?

#speaker 
Alice rubbed her chin, clearly thinking about Marisa’s proposal.

#speaker Alice
<i>You know, that is kinda true. Could’ve helped me when fighting against Cirno that time.
Goliath could shoot fireballs, do that dragon punch, maybe do that spinning tornado kick or something, all from that karate guy with a red headband. Hmm...</i>

#speaker Marisa
...You’re thinking of that arcade fighting game again, aren’t you?

#speaker Alice
H-Huh? Yeah! One has to find inspiration from other places to further improve their craft.

#speaker Marisa
Right... Anyway, have you ever thought of adding a magic broom onto Goliath?

#speaker Alice
That’s ridiculous. Alright, no more ideas from you. Let’s continue with the game.

#speaker Marisa
Aw man, think about it at least, Alice!

#speaker Marisa
Hey, it's Alice’s slaves!

#speaker Alice
I’m sorry? If Shanghai and Hourai heard that, they'd be very upset.

#speaker Marisa
Yeah, yeah. But I can’t get it out of my head though. What if you treat them like actual slaves? They are always under your mercy, y’know?

#speaker Alice
I suppose, as a doll maker, it does feel that way…

#speaker Marisa
So you’re saying you’re actually treating them as slaves?

#speaker Alice
N-No! Stop pushing your narrative onto me!

#speaker Marisa
Oh heck no, I’m getting to the bottom of this! And I know you can’t lie to save your life! Tell me, what do you do when a doll fails to execute your order?

#speaker Alice
I... reprimand them and ask them to do it again.

#speaker Marisa
Okay, what do you do if a doll defies your orders, should it happen to you?

#speaker Alice
I’ll probably make them learn not to do it again.

#speaker Marisa
Lastly, if a doll has betrayed you, what will you do?

#speaker Alice
I’ll ask them why, and depending on their answer, either help them with their problems or forgive them.

#speaker 
Marisa sighed. Alice is too good natured to treat the dolls badly.

#speaker Marisa
Alright alright. You win. But here’s the real question: What if I am your doll? What will you do to me?

#speaker 
Alice was taken aback by the question as she lowered her head and thought of an answer. Unfortunately for her, Marisa was not prepared for what Alice was about to say next.

#speaker Alice
I... would make sure no other dolls will harm you...

#speaker 
Marisa’s face almost had a visible red patch.

#speaker Marisa
R-Right! Of course! Alright, l-let’s continue with the game!
