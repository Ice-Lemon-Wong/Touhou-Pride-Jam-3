This is.. A Friend card?

#speaker Marisa
Friends? Ah right… I wonder how they are doing right now…

#speaker
Alice looked at her curiously, as Marisa had known a lot of people in her life, both in her adventures and “borrowing”.

#speaker Marisa
There’s the Scarlet Mansion inhabitants. Smart Patchouli, Master of the Manor Flandre Scarlet, and Koakuma. Then there is that kappa, I hope kappas live longer than me. 
And Kourin... As long as he does not die a stupid death, I won’t mind him outliving me. 
The Three Fairies, ah well... They are just going to lose another pranking partner. Komeiji sisters... I wish I could go down to the underground and hang out with you guys. 
And of course, <color=#ae2334>Reimu</color>. I hope that old lady had an heir or somebody else to take care of the shrine. Or else when I reincarnate and see no Hakurei successor, I’ll be really sad.
And lastly...

#speaker
She looked at Alice with her eyes, full of love and gratitude.

<color=#f04f78>You’re always more than a friend to me, my dear.</color>


#speaker
Alice can only hold back her tears as she kept the pair of cards. Although Marisa told her that sentence a lot of times, this time, it held a lot of weight in her heart.
