#speaker Alice
Oh, is that...?

#speaker Marisa
<color=#4d65b4>Patchouli’s hat! Hmm, what about patch and the Scarlet Devil mansion though?</color>

#speaker Alice
Yeah, I wonder who likes to steal from them, hmm...

#speaker Marisa
Oh c’mon, I was going to return to them! Well, one day, at least. 

#speaker Alice
Right... But, why steal from them though?

#speaker Marisa
Are you kidding? They have countless magic books undiscovered by humans! If I could read and master them all, I would be the greatest magician ever! I have a chance to surpass Reimu!

#speaker Alice
And also because of when they first came?

#speaker Marisa
Yeap, also because of that. Gotta keep them in check somehow. But lately Koakoma is tightening up the security in the Library, gonna be a little hard to infiltrate the premises

#speaker Alice
Need some help from the doll maker? 

#speaker Marisa
Ooooo, that would be lovely! You can send in your dolls to distract them, maybe let them play.
Then you can have a conversation with them, which further distracts them so I can steal even more books!

#speaker Koakuma
You both do know I can hear your conversation, RIGHT?!!!

#speaker 
Alice always finds it cute when Marisa planned for something like this, even though she essentially has a free pass into the mansion any time she wants.

#speaker Marisa
Eh, all this planning and no notepad to write it down. Let’s discuss this another time. Let’s continue the game!

#speaker Marisa
Hey it’s that hat again!

#speaker Alice
The Scarlet Devil group. The inhabitants of powerful magicians.

#speaker Marisa
Heck yea! They are quite awesome. I can keep going into the Library at any time I want.

#speaker Alice
You mentioned that a lot of times, you know?

#speaker Marisa
Well, what do you want me to talk about?

#speaker Alice
Oh, I don’t know, what about the person that writes the books you’ve “borrowed”?

#speaker Marisa
Hey, Pachi is a good librarian, alright? She lended me a couple of books I needed. The books I need for magical items, some books for spell cards, and a bunch of other books I need. 

#speaker Marisa
The best part? She can write all of them back, no biggie.

#speaker Alice
Does she not complain about your exploits?

#speaker Marisa
Hmm, not really. Most of the time she was busy writing a new book, reading a brand new book from somewhere, just simply doing her own thing in the mansion. 

#speaker Marisa
She seems to be a quiet person, like you Alice. Maybe I should visit her with the deck you have, eh?

#speaker Alice
Marisa, you gave me this deck as a gift. I won’t give it away easily.

#speaker 
Marisa laughed. She is definitely pulling her leg this time.

#speaker Marisa
Yeah, don’t worry. I can make a new one from my shop, hehe.

#speaker Alice
You know that you can’t even find anything in the shop, right?

#speaker Marisa
Eh hehehehe, yeah you’re right.

#speaker 
Alice was glad that she couldn't make another deck for Patchouli. She will be really angry as the meaning of her gift is lost thanks to Marisa’s antics.

#speaker Marisa
Got you being jealous, eh?

#speaker Alice
Yeah, yeah. Let’s just continue with the game, alright?
