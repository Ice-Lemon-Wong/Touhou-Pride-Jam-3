This card is...?

#speaker Marisa
Looks like <color=#f04f78>the netherworld</color>, I believe. The place where people go once they die.

#speaker Alice
Once they died huh...

#speaker Marisa
Y’know, I’ve read a lot of mythology for each different country and culture. Do you think some mean, big god will judge whether we will go to <color=#4d65b4>heaven</color> or <color=#ae2334>hell</color>, based on how we live our lives?

#speaker Alice
I mean, it doesn’t seem that far fetched. Gensokyo is filled with magical beings after all. We do have Yama, for starters.

#speaker Marisa
Ugh, and the worst part is that no one has ever seen him yet…

#speaker Alice
We haven’t died yet, silly.

#speaker Marisa
Yeah, well, I’m just afraid that’s all. What if Yama deemed me unworthy and sent me to Hell? I don’t wanna get tortured by demons!

#speaker Alice
Well I guess you’ll probably end up in the Netherworld. I doubt Lord Yama would allow you to Heaven.

#speaker Marisa
But the Netherworld is quite scary though! Tons of ghosts and phantoms lurk here, and all are dangerous!

Also there is that <color=#f04f78>gluttonous ghost</color> who seems to can’t stop thinking about eating...

#speaker Marisa
But speaking of Heaven, do people… really enjoy it there? I heard it is some kind of paradise for all humans. Like, what’s over there, really?

#speaker Alice
I... I don't know. No one has talked about it. How about your friend, Yukari? She knows what heaven looks like, right?

#speaker Marisa
She dodged the question when I asked her, so I don’t really know for sure. Maybe it is true...

#speaker Alice
What is true?

#speaker Marisa
That Heaven is truly sealed. No more humans allowed there.

#speaker 
Alice can only shake her head. At her age, she’ll probably think about this stuff. To top it off, Marisa was not immortal either.
But as much as she keeps questioning, the only way to find out is by herself.

#speaker Alice
We’ll never know unless we truly cross that boundary, alright? Let’s continue with the game, and think about this later.

#speaker Marisa
Alright alright, sorry if I made you worry about me. It comes with age.

#speaker Alice
So, you are old!

#speaker Marisa
Oh shush it, you! I don’t need more reminders!
