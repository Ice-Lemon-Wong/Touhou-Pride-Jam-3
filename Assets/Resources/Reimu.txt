#speaker Alice
A yin yang orb... Reminds me of-

#speaker Marisa
Reimu! My rival and bestie!

#speaker 
Alice does not know why, but she felt offended when Marisa called Reimu her “bestie”. And for some reason, she wanted to know more about Marisa’s thoughts and feelings about Reimu.

#speaker Alice
So... What do you think about Reimu?

#speaker Marisa
...What do you mean?

#speaker Alice
Like, do you see her as a good friend, or as... someone special?

#speaker Marisa
Well, a good friend of course!

#speaker 
Alice wanted to let out a sigh of relief, but she cannot rest easy just yet. She was preparing herself from Marisa’s straightforward-ness.

#speaker Marisa
We had travelled together, fighting youkais, fighting other big bads here and there. She’s a good fighting partner all in all, her talent and abilities are way beyond me.
But I swear, she cannot be saved when socializing! Whenever I want her to go out, she doesn’t want to! She always said duties, duties, duties. 
I understand her pain, and I can see that deep down, she just wants to be a normal girl, but her responsibilities as a shrine maiden is what stops her from following her desires.
Not to mention, she is an airhead! The other day I explained my new spell cards to her, she doesn’t seem to understand what it does until I literally use it on her.
And then she would scold me for trying to destroy the shrine! Also, whenever we went to eat, she always ordered the most simple dish. I just can’t handle it if I lived with her.

#speaker 
Marisa sighed. Alice looked at her with an expression that displays understanding. Seems like Reimu’s lifestyle and attitude are not compatible with Marisa’s outgoing personality.
She let out a sigh of relief, knowing that Reimu was not the most important person in her heart.

#speaker Marisa
Hmm? You seem to be relieved. What’s wrong?

#speaker Alice
N-Nothing! Let’s continue with the game shall we? Let's flip the cards!

#speaker Marisa
Yin Yang orb? Oh, Reimu!

#speaker Alice
That Hakurei shrine maiden huh… I’m curious. When did you guys first meet?

#speaker Marisa
Oh, that depends. Which timeline?

#speaker Alice
Uh...?

#speaker Marisa
Yeah, I’m just pulling your leg. We met together as enemies first, but I took interest in Reimu’s potential, and the rest is history.
Looking back, had I not been defeated by Reimu, I don’t know how my life would be..
...Because then I wouldn’t meet you and the others!

#speaker 
Alice was also glad that Marisa had met Reimu. She doesn't know what happens if they do not meet, but she knows that it will certainly be a boring immortal life.

#speaker Alice
Someday, I’ll thank her too.

#speaker Marisa
Hm? For what?

#speaker Alice
For allowing me to see you. I’m glad to have a noisy neighbour. Makes my house a little less lonely.

#speaker Marisa
Is that supposed to be a compliment or an insult...? 
Ah whatever, let’s continue!

#speaker Marisa
Ooooo, Yin Yang orb!

#speaker Alice
Reminds you of the Hakurei Shrine?

#speaker Marisa
Yeah, I bet she’s continuing her duties now. I have no idea what’s so important about those duties. I just hope she is okay.
Speaking of which...

#speaker Alice
Hm?

#speaker Marisa
What if we had our own shrines?

#speaker Alice
Oh, that is an interesting question. I wonder who will worship you?

#speaker Marisa
Oh that’s just cruel! But, believe it or not, I would want people to worship me as the great magician that I am.
Then I’ll probably finally be on par with Reimu. Hmm, hmm, yeah, that’s right. Take that Reimu!
What about you, Alice? What would you want to be worshipped as?

#speaker Alice
Hmm, I haven’t made the perfect doll yet, so I wouldn’t say that I want to be worshipped as a legendary doll maker. 

#speaker Marisa
But aren’t you popular with dolls?

#speaker Alice
Yeah, well, I just don't see myself as someone who has truly mastered it.

#speaker Marisa
You know that’s nonsense right?

#speaker Alice
What do you mean?

#speaker Marisa
Throughout my life, I’ve never seen someone who had crafted such amazing dolls for battle. Not only would you control them perfectly, you made it so that each of them have their own personality, their ideals, core values, so on and so forth. All thanks to your performance.
The fact that you did not use your grimoire is a testament to your abilities as a doll maker. You’re so good at it, you don’t even use it. Now have some self-respect for yourself, girl, cause I’ll give you some for ya!

#speaker 
Alice blushed. She never had someone believed in her so hard before. Oftentimes, people are too scared to compliment her, or are usually given by carefree fairies.
This time, an actual human is complimenting her, and she could not be even more happier than it is from Marisa.

#speaker Alice
Th-Thank you so much, Marisa.

#speaker Marisa
Alright, enough of worshipping each other. Let’s continue with the game!

#speaker Alice
<i>Uh, we were worshipping each other...?</i>
