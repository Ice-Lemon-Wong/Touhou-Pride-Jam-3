The girls went deep into the Forest of Magic, each holding a basket filled with delicious cakes and sandwiches. Marisa and Alice were chatting happily as Alice brought her deeper and deeper into the woods.
It has been 10 years since the Cafe de Gensokyo "date", and they have grown much closer ever since. Marisa brought her out to hand out more, and majority of the time Alice accepts them.
The times she did not accept was when she needed to fix her dolls up. Those times, Marisa can never break her concentration.
But this time, it's different. Alice asked her out on a picnic date. Marisa was taken aback by her sudden initiative, but accepted it nevertheless.

#speaker Marisa
Heyyy, where are you taking me to? I've never been in this part of the forest before.

#speaker Alice
Oh, you'll see, hehe.

#speaker 
As they continued walking, Marisa saw it in front of her eyes, a huge lake surrounded by the lush greenery of the forest. The lake shined crystal clear as the sunlight shines in.
The weather is fine, the birds are chirping and the ice fairy is cheerfully playing with her friends at the other side of the lake. It is a majestic sight for Marisa and the perfect place for a picnic. 

#speaker Marisa
Woah, this is AMAZING! I’ve never seen this place before! How did you know about this place? 

#speaker Alice
Let’s just say as a person who lives in the forest of magic is much more well versed in the forest than the one who just lives besides the forest.

#speaker 
They both chuckled while taking in the scenery.

#speaker Alice
Hey dummy! Can you help set up our picnic area?

#speaker 
Marisa closed her mouth, as it was previously open agap to amazement. She quickly went and helped her friend to set up the picnic table. 
With a little bit of magic, the setup was done in seconds, and they all settled down on the magically made table.

#speaker Marisa
Wow, Alice. I still can’t believe you would bring me to such a place. Guess it comes with age huh?

#speaker Alice
Says the one turning 25 this month. I brought us here so we can have a fun time together, without other worldly distractions.

#speaker 
After saying that, she unloaded the contents of her basket: two cans of soda, three shortcakes, and four packets of rice crackers. Marisa also does the same, revealing her sandwiches and biscuits.

#speaker Marisa
Hey, you should try one of these. It’s homemade.

#speaker 
Alice hastily took a bite out of a sandwich that Marisa made. The two sauces of the sandwich, combined with the softness of the cooked meat and lettuce, made it into a heavenly combination that melted into Alice’s mouth instantly.
Marisa noticed Alice’s facial expression, and felt proud that her sandwiches had touched the heart of the Magician.

#speaker Marisa
Well, I’m not the only one here improving my craft, hehe.

#speaker 
Once they have enjoyed the tea, sandwiches and cakes, Alice pulls out a small metal container.
Marisa looked at it curiously, before her eyes widened in surprise as Alice opened it and revealed the deck of magic cards that she had previously gifted her.

#speaker Marisa
Wow, you wanna play this game today? What mood brings this deck here?

#speaker Alice
Well, I hope we can have more meaningful conversations again, like last time.

#speaker Marisa
Are you sure you are just trying to get closer to me?

#speaker Alice
You do know I can’t lie, right?

#speaker 
This time Alice applied a bit of manipulation magic onto it. Her hands start to wave in gestures as the cards slowly fly up and around, but more elegantly than before.
It looks like she is controlling the card’s movement akin to making a puppet dance. She must have practiced this well long before this occasion, and now it so happens to be a good opportunity for her to impress Marisa.
The cards flew up reading both Marisa’s and Alice’s memories, feelings, and desires. Before long, it placed nicely into its layout.
Alice’s heart thumped in excitement. What can I get from her this time? She thought to herself excitedly.

#speaker Marisa
Hey, Earth to Alice! It's your turn now, y’know?

#speaker Alice
Ah, right!

#speaker 
Alice smiled gingerly as she placed the deck of cards back into the metal box.

#speaker Alice
<i>Today's plan is a success...!</i>

#speaker 
Marisa eyed her suspiciously, already curious what she was thinking about. Her lips opened, but instead turned into a smile as she probably had the same idea as hers.
She was about to ask to play another game, until they realized the sun had set. The girls quickly packed up their belongings before it got too dark.
As Alice picked up her basket, Marisa stood in front of her with a smile. She does not do this often, as Marisa usually rushes her to quickly go home or go to another place that she just immediately thinks of.
Most times, she verbally asks her to hurry up, while other times she grabs Alice’s hand and drags her to her next place of interest.
But this time, Alice saw Marisa leaning towards her, and their lips connected. Alice was a little shocked at how sudden this is, but she doesn’t stop Marisa.
Alice closed her eyes, letting this serene feeling of hers continue, maybe forever if she could.
After what seemed like forever, Marisa released herself from Alice. She let out a sigh, finally able to release her emotion. But when she looked up...

#speaker Marisa
Oh crap, time is running out!

#speaker 
Marisa pointed to the sky. It’s starting to become darker than before.

#speaker Marisa
If you weren’t so slow, it would’ve lasted five more minutes, hehe.

#speaker 
Alice pouted. She knew Marisa was just teasing her, but she could not help but imagine what if the kiss lasted five more minutes.

#speaker Marisa
C’mon, We’ll do it properly next time. Just..

#speaker 
Alice stopped pouting at this moment, and tilted her head with curiosity. Marisa looked at the ground, her face a little red. She does not seem to be this embarrassed before.

#speaker Marisa
….Make sure Reimu hears none of this, alright?

#speaker 
Alice performed a zipper pulling gesture across her lips, promising to keep her word.
Marisa disappeared again. Alice walked home, happier than before. She never felt this happy before in her life. Hanging out with Marisa was unbelievably a lot more fun, and all thanks to the cards making her able to feel comfortable talking to her.
She looked forward to these dates more and more, it is as if Marisa has a special place in her heart now.

#speaker Alice
<i>I want to see her again, I want to play cards with her again. I want to keep seeing her forever, and ever...</i>

#speaker 
The question is, will Marisa see Alice forever as well…?
