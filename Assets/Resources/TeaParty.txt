A teapot...?

#speaker Marisa
Having tea parties...Isn’t that what you like to do during your free time? Whenever you’re not working on your dolls that is.

#speaker Alice
I suppose that is true. I do enjoy having a good drink of tea whenever possible.

#speaker Marisa
Do you have anyone to drink tea with you?

#speaker Alice
Hmm, sometimes the <color=#4d65b4>Fairies of Light</color> will come and visit me. I drink with them most of the time, believing that they got lost again. You know how fairies work here.

#speaker Alice
Other than that, I’m mostly drinking alone with my dolls.

#speaker Marisa
Eh really? Like, do they talk to you, or..?

#speaker Alice
Yeah. Believe it or not, I understand them when they are talking.

#speaker Marisa
Of course, you’re the doll maker here…

#speaker Marisa
But really tho, no one else?

#speaker Alice
Yeah. There are other humans, but they got too scared and left before they even had a sip.

#speaker Marisa
That’s sad. Maybe I should visit your house one day. I’ll make you feel less lonely.

<i>Is that a direct flirt or...?</i>

#speaker 
Alice said nothing as Marisa kept the cards. Maybe she was right, Marisa is flirting with her. But for some reason, she does not want to ask, as she had only one reason why.

#speaker Marisa
Oh, a teapot!

#speaker Alice
Hmm, tea time, huh?

#speaker Marisa
That reminds me, what do you normally serve to your guests at home?

#speaker Alice
Hmm, I usually serve a normal, human tea to them, unless they are fairies. Then some sweet tea will do. 

#speaker Alice
As for cakes, I always serve shortcakes to them. Can’t go wrong with them.

#speaker Marisa
Hmm, that’s all? I guess not many people ate your cakes, huh?

#speaker Alice
Well, funny enough, my dolls always try to eat them.

#speaker Marisa
Uh, what?

#speaker Alice
Shanghai once attempted to eat the cake by <color=#4d65b4>smashing head first</color> onto it. Safe to say, she had to clean up her own mess at the table and on herself.

#speaker Marisa
Huh, never knew your dolls wanted a taste. Is it that good?

#speaker Alice
If the fairies are any indication, it’s probably... Decent I guess.

#speaker Marisa
Now I wanna be a guest in your house.

#speaker Alice
#text wave 52 68
Well, I don’t mind a new guest visiting my house... <color=#f04f78>especially you.</color>

Alice winked at Marisa, and she could only laugh.

#speaker Marisa
#text wait 1
You do know I visited your house way too many times right?

#speaker Alice
Yeah, that’s fair. Alright, that’s enough about my tea time. Let’s move on.

#speaker 
She looked at the card, reminiscing her days when Marisa would drink tea with her whenever they were dating. 
Marisa would complain about Alice’s taste in tea, and Alice would comment on how her tea is obviously the best choice. That was not before they started discussing the shortcakes that Alice made. 
Then one day, Marisa brought Alice to her home, and served her tea and shortcakes homemade by Marisa herself.  Though Alice would not admit it, it was very good, arguably better than her.

#speaker Alice
Maybe I’ll confess to her about that the next time I visit her. 
<color=#ae2334>But is there even next time...?</color>
