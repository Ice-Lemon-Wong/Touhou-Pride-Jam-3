-Intro
This is a story about 2 magicians,
with 2 different personalities,
One who is very outgoing,
The other who who prefer being alone.
But it is a matter of someone's gift, that will change her life...

Alice has probably the most bored face on her right now. She cannot believe where this black witch has taken her to.

Marisa looked at her with a frustrated look while her eyes closed. It is a miracle she avoided bumping into people while walking like this.

I saw this really cool shop while I’m on the way to see Reimu. A modern cafe, in our village, in the Forest of Magic!!

But Reimu, being a party pooper and all, doesn’t want to come with me. She kept saying <color=#4d65b4>“I got a shrine to take care of”</color> despite the fact that I cleaned up her work just yesterday!

#speaker Alice
I see. And you looked for me to go to this place? 

#portrait 1 marisa happy

#speaker Marisa
Yeap! I got really sad on the way home, until I saw your house. You need some fresh air too, so come along and let’s go to this <color=#905ea9>Cafe de Gensokyo!</color>

#speaker Alice
It’s newly made? Why did I not hear it before? Is it run by the <color=#ae2334>Scarlet Devil Mansion?</color>

#portrait 1 marisa neutral
#speaker Marisa
#text shake 127 133
Yeah it is, I saw Koakuma working here. And the building is quite recent, it was not here three days ago, and <size=25><b>BAM!!!</b></size> here it is.

It’s probably because of Patchouli’s magic capabilities and sakuya’s ability to stop time. They can make constructions like this a breeze.

Marisa looked ahead and continued marching giddy. Alice can only sigh and continue walking with her.

They stopped at their destination. It is much closer to their home than Alice expected. The bell on the door rang as they opened the door and walked inside.

#speaker 
Upon entering, they can immediately hear smooth jazz playing from a record player, the tunes you can only hear from a modern cafe like this.
Pairing with the warm lighting and scarlet red atmosphere, it is quite welcoming, it almost feels like you are in a bubble from the mundane feeling of life. 
The Scarlet Devil did outdid themselves. To top it off, Marisa was right, Koakuma did work here, she was behind the bar table, cleaning mugs. Her eyes gazed upon them when they entered. 

#speaker Koakuma
Welcome to our cafe- Oh, it’s you…

#speaker 
Koakuma looked at Marisa with a stern eye, and did not seem to be happy meeting a thief here. Marisa does not give her a good impression due to her “borrowing habits” at her master’s library.
Unfortunately for Koakuma, she has to contain her resentment to give them the best customer service or else the cafe’s reputation will be tarnished and be lectured by her master.

#speaker Koakuma
Please take a seat and tell me what you would like to order.

#speaker 
They sat down and ordered what they wanted. Koakuma took their orders and wrote it down in her notepad. It doesn't seem like anybody else worked here other than her.

#speaker Koakuma
Thank you for odering. Please wait while we prepare your orders.

#speaker 
Koakuma went into the kitchen preparing what they ordered. The two sat quitely for awhile. Not long after the silence started becoming... a little awkward.
Alice had this strange feeling, she had the urge to say something to Marisa, but she couldn't seem to pull herself to tak to her. The silence continued, but not for long.

#speaker Marisa
Hey, you want to check this cool little trinket I got recently?

#speaker 
Marisa pulled out a plastic box, it seems like a box that is used to package playing cards in it, but Alice felt a scent of magic in it.

#speaker Alice
Another one of your stolen items?

#speaker Marisa
Hey, I "borrowed" them, y'know? Besides, I found it while I'm adventuring yesterday for more secret magic books.

#speaker Alice
Okay, but what is so special about these cards?

#speaker Marisa
Hehe, you'll see.

#speaker 
Marisa excitedly reached for the deck, and opened the deck box. But as her finger touched the cards, it suddenly flew up all by itself, and danced around in the air.
Before long, the deck of cards flew around, circling Alice and Marisa in an elegant way, the card cover facing against them.
Alice and Marisa both looked at each other, then to the cards as it danced.
They know that the cards themselves are not dangerous, but they felt the cards just looked into them, into their soul, into their minds and their feelings.
After a few moments, the cards floated and placed themselves nicely on the table, in a <color=blue>five by two style</color> of arrangement. The girls looked at the cards laid on the table suspiciously.

#speaker Marisa
This is hella weird. I've never expected the cards to work that way.

#speaker Alice
You feel it too right? It looked into our memories.

#speaker Marisa
Yeah, I'm kinda sceptical about this. But we didn't feel any hostility. We should be safe to play this game I guess. Don't mind if I do!

#speaker Alice
Hand on, how do we play this game?

#speaker Marisa
Well, from what i've read from the box instructions, we both pick a card from the draft, if our cards are a matching pair, we will be magically convinced to start a conversation about the content in the card.
If it is not a matching pair, we will have to pick again. I don't exactly know in what form that we will be "magically convinced" to start a conversation but let's just go with it.

#speaker 
Alice seemed confused about the properties of these cards but she nodded. At least they had something to kill the time while they waited.

#speaker Marisa
If you're not making the first move, then I'll go first!

The girls finally placed the last two cards on top of the deck. They heaved a light sigh of relief as the game was over.

#speaker Marisa
Man, that was fun! It actually feels like I know you much, much better now as a person.

#speaker Alice
I never knew this game existed. It seems like the deck of cards are magically made to read into the user's minds, revealing their past information and printing it into the cards as an image to represent it. It truly is fascinating..

Ah, erm, well, not much.

#speaker Marisa
<size=30>Whaaat? You’re telling me you’ve never touched hands before?!!</size>

Alice shook her head. It seems being alone would miss out on some intimate social interactions.

#speaker Marisa
Hehe, let me help you with that.

The black witch got up from her seat and went to Alice’s. The doll maker seemed puzzled at Marisa’s words

#speaker Marisa
C’mon, there’s more space over there. Lemme in!

#speaker 
Alice complied, and let Marisa sit beside her. But before she can ask her what she is doing, Marisa placed her left hand onto Alice’s right hand, palms touching each other.. Marisa closed her fingers onto Alice’s hand.

#speaker Marisa
#text wave 0 20
C’mon, do the same.
#text reset all

#speaker 
A blushing Alice followed Marisa’s orders as she closed her fingers. They were now holding hands together, akin to what lovers would do when they sat beside each other.

#speaker Marisa
And just like that, I’m now your first time.

#speaker 
Alice could not stop blushing, and it does not help that Marisa’s directness is making her blush even further.

#speaker 
Satisfied, Marisa entangled herself off from the doll maker’s hand, before returning to her seat.

They drank the tea. It is surprisingly good, as well as the shortcakes. Rich in flavor, creamy and sweet at the same time.
The cake melts in their mouth with a single bite, spreading the flavours easily. A well baked cake all in all.
They commented about the meal before finishing up and paid at the counter.

<i>Not you though, you <color=#ae2334>thief</color>.</i>

#speaker 
Marisa simply scoffed at her. Either from her pompousness or the fact that she had beaten them time and time again in thievery. As they walked back home, the girls were talking much more than before.
Alice felt much more comfortable and closer to Marisa now, even though she had talked to here before this. It is more intimate then before, more heartwarming, like she just wants this moment to last.

Marisa started to swing her body left and right, and for some reason, she seems oddly shy this time.

#speaker Marisa
And if you have no one to play with... Well, you can find me! I don't mind if we play together, y'know, for funsies?
