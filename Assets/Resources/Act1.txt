Alice has probably the most bored face on her right now. She cannot believe where this black witch has taken her to.

Marisa looked at her with a frustrated look while her eyes closed. It is a miracle she avoided bumping into people while walking like this.

I saw this really cool shop while I’m on the way to see Reimu. A modern cafe, in our village, in the Forest of Magic!!

But Reimu, being a party pooper and all, doesn’t want to come with me. She kept saying <color="blue">“I got a shrine to take care of”</color> despite the fact that I cleaned up her work just yesterday!

I see. And you looked for me to go to this place?

Yeap! I got really sad on the way home, until I saw your house. You need some fresh air too, so come along and let’s go to this Cafe de Gensokyo!

#speaker Alice
It’s newly made? Why did I not hear it before? Is it run by the <color="red">Scarlet Devil Mansion?</color>

#speaker Marisa
Yeah it is, I saw Koakuma working here. And the building is quite recent, it was not here three days ago, and <color="red"><b>BAM!!!</b></color> here it is.  
It’s probably because of <color=#800080>Patchouli’s</color> magic capabilities and <color="blue">sakuya’s</color> ability to stop time. They can make constructions like this a breeze.

Marisa looked ahead and continued marching giddy. Alice can only sigh and continue walking with her.

You could’ve asked for Patchouli out you know, if you didn't keep <color="red">stealing her things...</color>

They stopped at their destination. It is much closer to their home than Alice expected. The bell on the door rang as they opened the door and walked inside.
